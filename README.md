# Psychopy Stimuli
Stimulus presentation in Python using Psychopy for the Relationships and Emotions Study. In this study, I assessed how participants; relationship affect their emotion regulation. I also measured participants' heart activity, to test theories that heart-rate variability may be a marker of self regulation. This scripts are for the study's emotion-regulation and heart-baseline tasks.

## Structure

- _emoreg.py_ file is an emotion regulation task, which shows participants pictures and asks them to either respond naturally, or to try to make themselves feel better about the picture. After each photo, participants rate their emotional state. The task assess how effectively participants down-regulate their negative emotion in response to upsetting photos.

- _emoregpractice.py_ file walks participants through a practice round of the emoreg.py emotion regulation task.

- _pacedbreathing.py_ and _picturerating.py_ are baseline tasks for heart-rate variability measurement.

- _pacedbreathing.py_ asks participants to match their breathing to the rhythm of rising and falling tone. This is used to record heart activity while standardizing breathing rate.

-  _picturerating.py_ asks participants to sit quietly and rate a series of pictures. This is used to record heart activity while participants breathe at their normal rhythm.
