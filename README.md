# psychopy-stimuli
Stimulus presentation in Python using Psychopy for the Relationships and Emotions Study.

The emoreg.py file is an emotion regulation task, which shows participants pictures and asks them to either respond naturally, or to try to make themselves feel better about the picture. The emoregpractice.py file walks participants through a practice round of this task.

The pacedbreathing.py and picturerating.py are baseline tasks for heart-rate variability measurement.

Paced breathing asks participants to match their breathing to the rhythm of rising and falling tone. This is used to record heart activity while standardizing breathing rate.

Picture rating asks participants to sit quietly and rate a series of pictures. This is used to record heart activity while participants breathe at their normal rhythm.
