# Psychopy Stimuli
Stimulus presentation in Python using Psychopy for the Relationships and Emotions Study.

## Structure

- _emoreg.py_ file is an emotion regulation task, which shows participants pictures and asks them to either respond naturally, or to try to make themselves feel better about the picture. 

- _emoregpractice.py_ file walks participants through a practice round of the emoreg.py emotion regulation task.

- _pacedbreathing.py_ and _picturerating.py_ are baseline tasks for heart-rate variability measurement.

- _pacedbreathing.py_ asks participants to match their breathing to the rhythm of rising and falling tone. This is used to record heart activity while standardizing breathing rate.

-  _picturerating.py_ asks participants to sit quietly and rate a series of pictures. This is used to record heart activity while participants breathe at their normal rhythm.
